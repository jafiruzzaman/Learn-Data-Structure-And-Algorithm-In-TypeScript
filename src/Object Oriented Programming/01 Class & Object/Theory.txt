========================================== Object Oriented Programming ==========================================
OOP is a programming paradigm that organizes software around objects (data + behavior), using classes as blueprints

1️⃣ What is class?
A class is a user-defined blueprint that defines properties (data) and methods (behavior).

2️⃣ What is Object?
Object: An object is a runtime instance of a class.

3️⃣ What is constructor
constructor: A constructor is a special method that initializes an object’s state at the time of creation.

4️⃣ What is method?
methods: Methods are functions defined inside a class that operate on the object’s data.

5️⃣ Access-Modifiers
public: access from anywhere
protected: Class itself + subclasses
private: Class itself only

6️⃣ Encapsulation: Encapsulation is the practice of bundling data and methods together and controlling access to internal state.
	Rules:
		1. private the data/fields
		2. set and get data/fields using getter & setters

7️⃣ Inheritance: Inheritance allows a child class to acquire properties and methods of a parent class.
	1. extends --> used to inherit parent class properties
	2. super --> to pass constructor value from child to parent

8️⃣ Abstraction: Abstraction focuses on defining what an object does, not how it does it.
	1. Abstract Class
	2. Abstract Method

9️⃣ Polymorphism : Polymorphism means many forms.
	1. Compile-time polymorphism is achieved by method overloading based on parameter types or count — not return type.
	2. Runtime polymorphism is achieved via method overriding using inheritance or interfaces.
